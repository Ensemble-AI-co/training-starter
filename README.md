This repository contains an example submission to the [Ensemble training competition](https://www.ensembleai.co/competitions/training).

To submit, simply drop model.pth, requirements.txt, and preprocess.py into the [submission area](https://www.ensembleai.co/competitions/training?competition_slug=training&tab=submit)

This repository also includes a notebook which demonstrates how each element of the example submission was constructed.
